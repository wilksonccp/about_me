# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Wilkson, and I am a dedicated learner in the world of programming, currently focusing on C# and .NET. While I'm still early in my journey, I have a strong grasp of programming logic and am continually exploring new tools and technologies to expand my skill set.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals:** My primary goal is to develop as a back-end developer, with the ambition to eventually transition into DevOps. I'm passionate about challenges and am always open to contributing to open-source projects, applying and improving my knowledge, and building a portfolio that showcases my skills.

ðŸš€ **Interests:** In addition to programming, I have a keen interest in entrepreneurship and digital marketing, areas that I believe are crucial for any developer who wants to make a positive impact in the market and the community.
